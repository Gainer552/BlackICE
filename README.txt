BlackICE

BlackICE is a host hardening utility for Linux systems that locks down your network stack with ultra-hardened UFW configurations — while still allowing safe web browsing (HTTPS, DNS, NTP, DHCP).

Overview

BlackICE is designed for users who want a near-impenetrable local firewall without losing essential online functionality. It configures UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) with a restrictive “deny-all” policy, then selectively allows minimal outbound traffic required for browsing, while fully disabling all inbound connections.

This script also applies deep kernel-level hardening (via sysctl) to block redirects, source routing, TCP fingerprinting, and other network-layer vectors often used in exploitation.

Features

- Inbound traffic: completely blocked by default.  
- Outbound traffic: limited to HTTPS, encrypted DNS, NTP, DHCP.  
- Encrypted DNS enforcement (DoT/DoH) with optional plaintext fallback.  
- Kernel hardening: disables source routing, redirects, ICMP abuse, TCP timestamps, and SACK.
- Verbose logging: ufw logging high for maximum visibility.
- Auto-detection of DNS resolvers from /etc/resolv.conf
- Safe defaults: browser functionality intact, minimal exposure footprint.  
- No dependencies: uses only built-in Linux tools (bash, ufw, sysctl).

Usage

1. Clone or download the script: git clone https://github.com/Gainer552/BlackICE.git

2. chmod +x blackice.sh

3. Run it with root privileges: sudo ./blackice.sh

4. (Optional) Dry-run mode — preview actions without applying changes: sudo DRY_RUN=true ./blackice.sh

5. Verify firewall status: sudo ufw status verbose

Configuration Variables

Inside the script, you can adjust:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `ALLOW_HTTP` | Allow HTTP (port 80) traffic | `false` |
| `ALLOW_PLAINTEXT_DNS` | Allow normal DNS (UDP/TCP 53) instead of encrypted DNS | `false` |
| `DRY_RUN` | Simulate changes without applying | `false` |

> By default, BlackICE allows only HTTPS, DoT/DoH, NTP, and DHCP — this provides full web functionality while minimizing exposure.

Example Behavior

After installation:

- All inbound packets are dropped.  
- Only essential outbound traffic leaves your machine.  
- DNS lookups are encrypted (if supported).  
- Logs record every blocked attempt at /var/log/ufw.log.  
- Browsing works (HTTPS + DNS), but background telemetry and most services are firewalled off.

Reverting Changes

If something breaks or you need to undo the changes:

- sudo ufw --force reset
- sudo rm /etc/sysctl.d/99-ultra-harden.conf
- sudo sysctl --system
